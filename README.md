# Car_Fare_Prediction
Import Libraries: Use libraries like pandas for data handling, numpy for numerical operations, and scikit-learn.

Load and Preprocess Data: Import datasets (e.g., trip data) and clean them. Remove missing values, outliers, and perform data normalization/scaling.

Feature Selection: Extract key features such as fare_amount, pickup_datetime, pickup_longitude, pickup_latitude, dropoff_longitude, dropoff_latitude, and passenger_count.

Feature Engineering: Add derived features like rush_hour_flag, weekend_flag, or traffic_intensity.

Train-Test Split: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets, typically using an 80:20 or 70:30 ratio with train_test_split from scikit-learn.

Model Selection: Choose algorithms like linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or neural networks depending on complexity and data size.

Model Training: Train the model on the training dataset. For instance:
os: Facilitates file input/output operations such as handling file paths and directory manipulations.

pandas: Essential for loading, manipulating, and analyzing structured datasets using dataframes.

numpy: Used for efficient numerical operations and array handling.

matplotlib.pyplot: Enables creating basic data visualizations such as line plots, bar plots, and scatterplots.

seaborn: Provides an interactive and aesthetically pleasing layer for advanced data visualizations.

collections.Counter: Used to efficiently count occurrences of elements in data, such as analyzing categorical features.

Machine Learning Algorithms:

DecisionTreeRegressor: A tree-based model suitable for regression tasks.

RandomForestRegressor and GradientBoostingRegressor: Ensemble learning models for more robust predictions.

LinearRegression: A simple yet effective algorithm for linear relationships in data.

Model Development Utilities: train_test_split: Splits datasets into training and test sets for model evaluation.

RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV: Tools for hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

Evaluation Metrics:
mean_squared_error: Measures prediction error.

r2_score: Assesses how well predictions fit the actual data.

Miscellaneous:-
pprint: Provides pretty-printing of data for clearer output.

%matplotlib inline: Ensures that visualizations render inline in environments like Jupyter Notebooks.
